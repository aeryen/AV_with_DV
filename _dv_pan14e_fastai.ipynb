       "' English, my English!  \\t xcrlfx One of my first experiences with the English language was, when I at nine understood the contains of a conversation between my parents.  xcrlfx As they discussed what they thought to be a secret topic, hidden behind the language barrier, they were astonished when their little boy said \"I didn\\'t do it \". - Running away in triumph, finally having cracked their code.  xcrlfx After this incident my interest of listening to English, writing English and speaking the language only increased.   xcrlfx Now 12 years later it\\'s interesting looking back at what I have learnt.   xcrlfx When I am having a conversation or when I am writing, it is obvious to me what are my strengths and weaknesses.  xcrlfx In the following paragraphs I will try to assess my overall abilities in the English language.   xcrlfx It\\'s without a doubt that media has a great impact on young people in our society.  xcrlfx Radio, television and the Internet brings the world close to us.  xcrlfx And since many of the programs and articles found here are in English, it forces us, in a positive sense, to learn and understand the language.   xcrlfx I guess one can speak of unconscious learning.  xcrlfx Speaking for my self, I know that watching and listening to television, radio and music has contributed a great deal in my understanding of the language.  xcrlfx And today I feel quite able to follow discussions at a higher level.   xcrlfx When it comes to reading, I am ashamed to say that I\\'ve probably read to little.  xcrlfx This does off course inflict on certain aspects of my reading.  xcrlfx What I sometimes experience, is an insufficient vocabulary.  xcrlfx I have no problems with understanding the context.  xcrlfx In fact, I believe that this is one of my strengths.  xcrlfx But, by missing certain essential words, problems do occur.  xcrlfx This often results in funny and embarrassing misunderstandings.   xcrlfx Writing is one of the things I definitely want to improve.  xcrlfx Both when it comes to spelling and grammar but also regarding style.  xcrlfx When I started this course I got shocked over my abilities, or perhaps one should say disabilities, concerning grammar and grammatical terms.  xcrlfx It\\'s not that I can\\'t use the language in writing.  xcrlfx But, when it comes down to explaining how language is constructed and which explicit rules we follow, I face problems.  xcrlfx This is something that I am sure will change during the course.  xcrlfx However, I take great pleasure in writing and hope to continue with it.   xcrlfx The skill of speaking English is perhaps the most important.  xcrlfx Fluency in speech, intonation and vocabulary are often regarded as the essentials in the teaching of oral communication.  xcrlfx I am afraid having an American mother whose use of the English language was limited to the few times she lost her temper, (For crying out loud!  xcrlfx What have you been up to?\")  xcrlfx didn\\'t help much.  xcrlfx She wanted us to learn proper Norwegian and thought that her rusty pronunciation and vocabulary would contribute.  xcrlfx No offence mum.  xcrlfx Despite this, sometimes confusing, mixture of language and grammar I have become quite competent in them both.  xcrlfx Off course there are always room for improvement.  xcrlfx What I experience when I speak English, is the shortage of words, or rather the lack of routine using my vocabulary.  xcrlfx There is only one solution to this problem and that is to speak more.  xcrlfx Perhaps one should go abroad for a year or two.    xcrlfx There are many things that influence a young person learning a foreign language.  xcrlfx As I see it teachers, environment and family are especially important.  xcrlfx I have been lucky when it comes to these things, good teachers, in most cases, a challenging and stimulating environment and an interested and helpful family.   xcrlfx To reach a general conclusion I guess one can say that my strength is in the understanding of conversation and text.  xcrlfx And when it comes to the parts were I feel that I could improve, practical use of my vocabulary and pronunciation comes to mind I am sure that these next months, being in an academic, English speaking environment, will give me practical training in using my language. xcrlfx '"
